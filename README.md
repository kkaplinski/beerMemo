# beerMEMO v1

Hi ! This is first version of my beerMemo application. This application was created with RN and few very helpful open source libraries.
I implemented React Native Navigation from Wix and Watermelon DB to handle data. Async are handled by Redux store. 

You can also test this app by downloading it from Google Play Market. It should be available soon.

## Installation

Use the package manager to install all dependencies, and Android Studio to build app on device

```
npm install
```
## Usage

You can add your favorite beer and collect them in a Beer Collection. App has also  sort and search functionality. The user UI is very simple and intuitive. There is a lot of information you can put on a one beer detail screen component.
